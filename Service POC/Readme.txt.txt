1. This proof of concept (POC) handles button click events. When the Start button is clicked, it triggers the onBind() method; when the Stop button is clicked, it triggers the onDestroy() method.

2. The onBind() method binds the media player to the service, so when the user clicks the Start button, the media player starts playing.

3. The onDestroy() method unbinds and stops the media player. When the user clicks the Stop button, the media player stops.
